# Introduction

The SOLID Principle was introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob.


SOLID Principles are the 05 principles of Object-Oriented Design(OOD). They are the rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure.
SOLID is the acronym for the below 05 principles:-


S: Single Responsibility Principle(SRP)

O: Open/Close Principle 

L: 

I: 

D: 

## Advantages of following the SOLID Principles:-


1. Reduce code ``redundancy``(i.e. duplication of code).
2. Results in loose ``coupling``.
3. Makes software ``flexible``.
4. Reduces ``complexity``.
5. Easy to ``understand``.
6. Easy to ``maintain``.

> What is coupling?

It is the degree of interdependence of modules or classes.


Tight Coupled: Modules/Classes are called tightly coupled if they are highly dependent on each other. It should be avoided, because, if we make changes in one module/class it will affect the others' dependent 
modules/classes.


Loose Coupled: Modules/Classes are called loosely coupled if they are independent of each other. A loosely coupled code is considered better because changes in one module/class won't affect any other modules/classes.
Therefore, it makes our code flexible, stable, maintainable, and reusable.

# Single Responsibility Principle

It states that:-

1. A class or method should have **only ONE reason to change**.
2. A class or method should have **only ONE responsibility**.
